# An Open Clock
A Simple Factorio mode that gives in-game time in a small UI widget

## Features so far

* Shows in-game time :D
* Hideable: enabled on server but you don't care? Hide it! It will also stop processing while hidden
* Libre: published under GPL v3

I'm open to ideas so don't hesitate to ask if you want specific features!
